# TravellingSalesman

### TSP formulation:
A traveling salesman needs to go through ```n``` cities to sell his merchandise. There's a road between each two cities, but some roads are longer and more dangerous than others. Given the cities and the cost of traveling between each two cities, what's the cheapest way for the salesman to visit all of the cities and come back to the starting city, without passing through any city twice?
